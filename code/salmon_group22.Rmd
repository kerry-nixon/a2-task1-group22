This data set used in this report was accessed from [Columbia River DART](http://www.cbr.washington.edu/dart) and includes counts of adult fish passages through the Willamette Falls fish ladder between January 1, 2001 and December 31, 2010. This report focuses on adult and jack Coho salmon (*Oncorhynchus kisutch*) and Steelhead Trout (*Oncorhynchus mykiss*). The results of the report display time series and season plots of Coho and Steelhead fish passages through Willamette Falls, as well as annual totals per species.
```{r}
full_fish <- read_csv(here("data", "willamette_fish_passage.csv"))

## Time Series

# Data wrangling
fish <- full_fish %>% 
  select("Project", "Date", "Steelhead","Coho","Jack Coho")

fish_ts <- fish %>% 
  mutate(Date = lubridate::mdy(Date)) %>% 
  as_tsibble(key = NULL, index = Date)

# Exploratory graph
ggplot(data = fish_ts, aes(x = Date, y = Steelhead)) +
