# Overview {.tabset}


The data set used in this report was accessed from [Columbia River DART](http://www.cbr.washington.edu/dart) and includes counts of adult fish passages through the Willamette Falls fish ladder between January 1, 2001 and December 31, 2010. This report is concerned with three species in particular: Coho Salmon (*Oncorhynchus kisutch*), Jack (young) Coho salmon (*Oncorhynchus kisutch*) and Steelhead Trout (*Oncorhynchus mykiss*). The results of the report are displayed as a time series plot, season plot, and total annual counts of adult fish passages through Willamette Falls by species.

#### Analysis:
- Fish passage through Willamette Falls fish ladder displays seasonality for all three species but seasonal peaks differ between Steelhead and the Coho salmon
- Fish passage through the fish ladder displays cyclicality for Coho and Jack Coho Salmon over period of 2 to 4 years
- Adult Coho salmon passage through the fish ladder displays an overall positive trend from 2007 to 2010

#### Analysis:
- Coho and Jack Coho peak seasonally in early October, with Jack Coho having the most centralized observations
- Coho salmon observations have increased since 2001 and have the highest number of observations in a particular month
- Steelhead salmon have the longest period of observation, ranging from January to August, peaking in June

#### Analysis:

- Jack Coho Salmon were the least commonly observed fish overall, and had a dramatic increase in numbers (over a fifteen-fold increase from 2007 to 2008) in the last three years of the study.

- Steelhead Trout were the most numerous fish observed throughout the study, the number of fish observed showed greater variability in the first five years of the study and greater stability, though lower numbers, in the second five years.

- The number of Coho Salmon observed passing through the Willamette Falls fish ladder varied throughout the study with a large increase int he last two years (with a more than five-fold increase between 2008 and 2009).
